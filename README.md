- 👋 Hi, I’m @rateshb
- 👀 I’m interested in meeting people having ReactNative skills or interest in app development. I am working on my own startup and would like to meet similar minded people.
Who wants to start their own. I have a few ideas and would like the help of app developers to help me build them. I myself is a backend developer with knowledge in Java, Spring, Hibernate, python etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Technical Analysis of stocks and working on an algorithm for the same.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various technologies if we have the same mind set.
- 📫 You can reach me @ rateshb@gmail.com
